Traditional Moroccan Feqqas (Fekkas)
Feqqas is a traditional Moroccan twice-baked biscuit, similar to Italian cantuccini or biscotti. It is prized for its crunch and the aromatic blend of toasted nuts and seeds.

Ingredients
Dry Base: 500g (4 cups) all-purpose flour, 150g (¾ cup) granulated sugar, 1 tsp baking powder, and a pinch of salt.
Aromatics: 2 tbsp toasted sesame seeds, 1 tbsp anise seeds, and 1 tbsp orange blossom water.
Nuts: 100g whole almonds (soak in water or orange blossom water for 20 minutes beforehand to prevent them from breaking during slicing).
Wet Base: 2–3 large eggs and 125ml (½ cup) vegetable oil.
Glaze: 1 egg yolk mixed with 1 tsp instant coffee or milk for a golden finish.

Instructions
1. Prepare the Dough
Whisk the eggs, sugar, oil, and orange blossom water in a large bowl until smooth.
Stir in the almonds, sesame seeds, and anise seeds.
Gradually add the flour and baking powder. Mix until a soft, non-sticky dough forms (do not over-knead).

2. First Bake (Setting the Shape)
Divide the dough into 3 or 4 logs (about 3cm/1.2 inches thick).
Place logs on a parchment-lined tray and brush the tops with the egg yolk glaze.
Bake at 180°C (350°F) for 15–20 minutes until firm and lightly golden but not fully cooked.

3. The Resting Period (Crucial Step)
Remove logs from the oven and cover them immediately with a damp kitchen towel.
Let them rest for at least 6 hours or overnight. This softens the crust, allowing you to slice them without the biscuit cracking or the almonds shattering.

4. Second Bake (The Crunch)
Using a very sharp or serrated knife, slice the logs diagonally into 1cm (½ inch) thick pieces.
Arrange the slices flat on a baking sheet.
Reduce the oven to 160°C (320°F) and bake for 10–15 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden brown and crisp on both sides.

Pro Tips
Easy Slicing: If you are in a hurry, you can use the "damp towel" method for just 1 hour, but overnight rest is the traditional secret for perfect edges.
Modern Twist: Add 50g of raisins or dried cranberries for a sweeter, chewier variation.
Storage: Store in an airtight container once completely cool; they will stay crunchy for several weeks.

Classic French Charlotte aux Fraises (Strawberry Charlotte)
This classic French Charlotte aux Fraises consists of a ring of ladyfingers surrounding a light, airy strawberry Bavarian cream.

Ingredients
For the Shell & Base:
- Ladyfingers (Sponge Fingers): Approx. 30–40 biscuits (enough to line the sides and bottom of your mold).
- Simple Syrup: 1/2 cup water and 1/3 cup sugar, boiled and cooled. (Optional: add 1 tbsp lemon juice or strawberry liqueur).

For the Strawberry Mousse (Bavarian Cream):
- Fresh Strawberries: 1 lb (500g), hulled. Reserve some for decoration; puree the rest.
- Heavy Cream: 1 ½ cups (350ml), well chilled for whipping.
- Sugar: 1/2 cup (100g).
- Gelatin: 1 tbsp (or 4–5 sheets), bloomed in 1/4 cup cold water.
- Vanilla Extract: 1 tsp.

Instructions
1. Prepare the Strawberry Base
Puree the strawberries with the sugar using a blender. Warm about 1/3 of this puree in a saucepan, then stir in the bloomed gelatin until completely dissolved. Mix this back into the remaining cold puree and add the vanilla.

2. Whip the Cream
In a chilled bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the strawberry-gelatin mixture into the whipped cream using a spatula until smooth and uniform.

3. Assemble the Shell
Trim the biscuits: Lightly cut one end off the ladyfingers so they can stand upright.
Dip & Line: Quickly dip the non-sugared side of each ladyfinger into the syrup. Line the walls of a 7 or 8-inch springform pan with the biscuits, sugared side facing outward.
The Base: Line the bottom of the pan with more syrup-dipped ladyfingers, trimming them to fit snugly.

4. Fill and Chill
Pour half of the strawberry mousse over the bottom layer of biscuits.
(Optional) Add a middle layer of sliced strawberries or more ladyfingers.
Pour in the remaining mousse and smooth the top with a spatula.
Chill: Refrigerate for at least 4 to 6 hours, or ideally overnight, to let the gelatin set.

5. Serve
Carefully remove the springform ring. Decorate the top with fresh whole or sliced strawberries. For a classic finish, tie a decorative ribbon around the biscuits before serving.

Authentic Italian Bomboloni Recipe
Ingredients
For the dough:
500g (approx. 4 cups) All-purpose flour or Bread flour
250ml (1 cup) Whole milk, lukewarm
70g (1/3 cup) Granulated sugar
70g (5 tbsp) Unsalted butter, softened at room temperature
1 Large egg, room temperature
7g (2 ¼ tsp) Active dry yeast or Instant yeast
A pinch of salt
Zest of 1 lemon or orange (optional)
For frying and coating:
Vegetable oil (for deep frying)
Extra granulated sugar (for coating)
For the filling:
Pastry cream (crema pasticcera), Nutella, or jam.
Instructions
Activate the Yeast: In a small bowl, mix the lukewarm milk with a teaspoon of sugar and the yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.
Mix the Dough: In a large bowl (or stand mixer), combine the flour, the remaining sugar, and the salt. Add the yeast mixture, the egg, and the citrus zest. Knead until a dough starts to form.
Incorporate Butter: Gradually add the softened butter, piece by piece, while kneading. Continue kneading for about 10 minutes until the dough is smooth, elastic, and no longer sticky.
First Rise: Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 2 hours, or until doubled in size.
Shape the Bomboloni: On a floured surface, roll out the dough to a thickness of about 1.5 cm (1/2 inch). Use a round pastry cutter (approx. 8cm) to cut out circles. Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Second Rise: Cover the circles and let them rise again for 45 to 60 minutes. They should be very puffy.
Fry: Heat the oil to 170°C (340°F). Fry the dough circles for about 2 minutes per side until golden brown. Do not overcrowd the pot.
Coat: Remove the beignets and drain them briefly on paper towels. While still hot, roll them in granulated sugar.
Fill: Once cooled, use a piping bag with a small nozzle to poke a hole in the side or top and inject your chosen filling.
Tips:

Make sure the oil is not too hot, otherwise the outside will burn while the inside remains raw.

Traditional zeppole fall into two categories: the simple "doughnut hole" style often found at festivals, and the more elaborate Zeppole di San Giuseppe, which are shaped like nests and filled with cream. 
Below is the authentic recipe for Zeppole di San Giuseppe, including the traditional pastry cream and black cherry garnish. 
Ingredients
For the Pastry Cream (Filling)
Milk: 2 ½ cups whole milk
Egg Yolks: 4 large
Sugar: 4 tbsp granulated
Thickener: 4 tbsp all-purpose flour and 2 tbsp cornstarch
Flavoring: Zest of ½ lemon and 1 vanilla bean (or 1 tsp extract) 
For the Choux Pastry (Dough)
Liquid: 1 cup water
Butter: ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted
Flour: 1 cup all-purpose
Eggs: 3–4 large eggs, at room temperature
Salt & Sugar: ⅛ tsp salt and 1 tbsp sugar 
Garnish
Amarena cherries in syrup (authentic) or Maraschino cherries
Powdered sugar for dusting 
Instructions
1. Make the Pastry Cream
Infuse: Heat milk with lemon zest and vanilla seeds in a saucepan until just simmering (do not boil).
Whisk: In a separate bowl, whisk egg yolks and sugar until pale. Add flour and cornstarch.
Temper: Slowly drizzle some hot milk into the egg mixture while whisking constantly. Pour everything back into the saucepan.
Thicken: Cook over medium-low heat, whisking continuously until the mixture becomes a thick custard (about 5–7 minutes).
Cool: Transfer to a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap pressing directly onto the surface to prevent a skin. Chill in the fridge until completely cold. 
2. Prepare the Dough (Choux Pastry)
Boil: In a medium saucepan, combine water, butter, sugar, and salt. Bring to a rolling boil.
Stir: Remove from heat and add flour all at once. Stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until it forms a smooth ball.
Dry: Return to low heat for 1–2 minutes, stirring constantly until a thin film forms on the bottom of the pan.
Add Eggs: Transfer the dough to a bowl. Let it cool for a few minutes, then beat in eggs one at a time. Do not add the next egg until the previous one is fully incorporated. The dough should be smooth and glossy. 
3. Cooking (Choose Fried or Baked)
Fried (Traditional): Heat vegetable oil to 350°F (175°C). Pipe 3-inch "nest" circles onto small squares of parchment paper. Drop the paper-side-up into the oil; the paper will peel off as they cook. Fry until golden brown (about 2–3 minutes per side).
Baked (Lighter): Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Pipe nests onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake for 25–30 minutes until deeply golden. Do not open the oven door during baking to prevent collapsing. 
4. Assembly
Once cooled, dust with powdered sugar.
Using a star tip, pipe a generous swirl of pastry cream into the center of each nest.
Top each one with an Amarena cherry and a small drizzle of its syrup.

Ingredients
The Sponge (Starter)
1/2 cup (60g) bread flour
1/4 cup (60ml) warm milk or water
1 tbsp (7g) instant dry yeast
1 tsp sugar 
The Main Dough
Dry: 3 ½ to 4 cups bread flour, 2/3 cup sugar, 1 tsp salt
Wet: 3 large eggs + 2-3 egg yolks, 1/2 cup warm milk, 1 tsp vanilla extract
Fats: 12–15 tbsp (approx. 170–200g) unsalted butter, softened
Flavorings: Zest of 1 orange and 1 lemon, 2 tbsp rum or honey
Fruits: 1 cup raisins (soaked in rum or water) and 1/2 cup candied orange/citron peel 
Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Prepare the Sponge
Mix the starter ingredients in a small bowl until bubbly (approx. 20–30 minutes). 
2. Mix the Primary Dough
In a stand mixer with a dough hook, combine the sponge with the flour, sugar, eggs, milk, and salt. Knead on low speed for 8–10 minutes until smooth and elastic. 
3. Incorporate Butter and Proof
Slowly add softened butter one tablespoon at a time, ensuring each piece is fully absorbed before adding more. The dough should be silky and pass the "windowpane test" (stretching without tearing). Cover and let rise in a warm spot until doubled (2–3 hours) or refrigerate overnight for better flavor. 
4. Add Fruit and Shape
Gently fold in the soaked raisins and candied peels. Shape the dough into a ball and place it into a panettone paper mold (or a deep, greased tin). 
5. Final Proof and Scoring
Let the dough rise again in the mold until it nearly reaches the rim (another 2–3 hours). Use a sharp blade to score a shallow "X" on top and place a small knob of butter in the center. 
6. Bake and Cool
Bake: At 350°F (175°C) for 45–55 minutes. If the top browns too quickly, cover loosely with foil.
Cooling (Crucial): To prevent the tall dome from collapsing, pierce the bottom of the warm loaf with long skewers and hang it upside down between two pots or stacks of books for at least 4–6 hours. 
Pro Tip: For the best results in 2026, ensure your ingredients (except the starter) are slightly chilled to keep the dough temperature below 26°C (79°F) during heavy kneading.

This authentic recipe for Crostata di Marmellata (Jam Tart) uses a traditional pasta frolla (sweet shortcrust pastry) and can be made in just over an hour. 
Ingredients
For the Pasta Frolla:
Flour: 2 ½ cups (300g) all-purpose or Italian "00" flour.
Butter: 1 cup (225g) unsalted butter, cold and cubed.
Sugar: ½ cup (100g) granulated sugar.
Eggs: 1 whole large egg + 2 large egg yolks.
Flavorings: Zest of 1 organic lemon and 1 tsp vanilla extract.
Leavening: 1 tsp baking powder (optional, for a softer crust) and a pinch of salt. 
For the Filling:
Jam: 1 ½ cups (approx. 400g) of high-quality jam (apricot, cherry, or raspberry are traditional). 
Instructions (2026 Edition)
Prepare the Dough:
In a large bowl or food processor, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
Add the cold, cubed butter. Pulse or use your fingertips to rub it into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse sand.
Add the whole egg, yolks, lemon zest, and vanilla. Mix briefly just until the dough starts to clump together. Do not overwork the dough, or it will become tough.
Chill:
Gather the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and flatten it into a disk.
Refrigerate for at least 30 to 60 minutes.
Assemble the Tart:
Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease and flour a 9 or 10-inch tart pan (preferably with a removable bottom).
Roll out about 2/3 of the dough on a lightly floured surface to roughly 1/8-inch (3mm) thickness. Transfer to the pan, pressing it into the edges.
Prick the bottom with a fork to prevent air bubbles.
Spread the jam evenly over the base.
Create the Lattice:
Roll out the remaining 1/3 of the dough and cut it into 1-inch wide strips.
Arrange the strips in a crisscross or diamond pattern over the jam.
Fold any overhanging dough from the base inward to create a rustic border.
Bake:
Bake for 30 to 40 minutes until the crust is golden brown and the jam is bubbling.
Cool completely in the pan before slicing; this allows the jam to set so it doesn't run when cut.
