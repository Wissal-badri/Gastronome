Classic Vanilla Crème Brûlée Recipe
Yields: 4 servings
Prep time: 15 minutes
Cook time: 35–50 minutes
Chill time: At least 4 hours
Total time: ~5 hours

Ingredients
- 2 cups (450ml) heavy whipping cream
- 1 vanilla bean (split lengthwise, seeds scraped) or 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 4 large egg yolks
- ¼ cup (50g) granulated sugar (for the custard)
- 4 tablespoons granulated sugar or turbinado sugar (for the topping)
- Pinch of salt
- Boiling water (for the water bath)

Equipment
- 4 (6-ounce) ramekins
- Large baking dish (roasting pan)
- Fine-mesh sieve
- Kitchen blowtorch (recommended) or oven broiler

Instructions
1. Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C). Place the 4 ramekins in a large baking dish.
2. Infuse Cream: In a medium saucepan, heat the heavy cream with the vanilla seeds and pod (or vanilla extract) and a pinch of salt over medium heat until it just begins to simmer. Do not let it boil. Remove from heat, cover, and let infuse for 15 minutes.
3. Whisk Yolks and Sugar: In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks and ¼ cup sugar until pale, thick, and well-blended.
4. Temper the Eggs: Slowly pour about ½ cup of hot cream into the yolk mixture while whisking constantly. Then, whisk in the remaining cream.
5. Strain and Pour: Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve. Divide evenly among the ramekins.
6. Bake in Water Bath: Place the baking dish in the oven. Pour boiling water into the dish to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake for 35–45 minutes until set but still jiggly in the center.
7. Chill: Remove from water bath, cool to room temp, then cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours (ideally overnight).
8. Caramelize Sugar: Just before serving, blot condensation from tops. Sprinkle 1 tbsp sugar on each.
   - Using a Torch: Melt moving flame continuously until deep golden-brown.
   - Using a Broiler: Broil on high for 1–2 minutes, watching constantly.
9. Serve: Allow crust to harden for a few minutes before serving.

Classic American-Style Fluffy Pancakes
Here is a simple and delicious recipe for classic American-style fluffy pancakes.

Ingredients
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 3 ½ tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 Tbsp sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 ¼ cups milk
- 3 Tbsp unsalted butter, melted (plus extra for frying and serving)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract (optional)
- Optional toppings: maple syrup, fresh berries, sliced bananas, whipped cream

Instructions
Step 1: Combine the dry ingredients
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.

Step 2: Combine the wet ingredients
In a separate medium bowl, whisk the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract (if using) until smooth and well blended.

Step 3: Mix the batter
Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients. Stir gently with a spatula or whisk until just combined. It is okay if the batter is a little lumpy; do not overmix, as this can make the pancakes tough. Let the batter rest for 5 to 10 minutes while the pan heats up.

Step 4: Cook the pancakes
Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease the surface with a little butter or oil. Pour ¼ cup of batter onto the hot pan for each pancake. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set.

Step 5: Flip and serve
Flip the pancakes carefully with a thin spatula and cook for an additional 1 to 2 minutes, until golden brown on the other side. Repeat the process with the remaining batter. Serve the pancakes warm, stacked on a plate, with your favorite toppings.

Cinnamon Rolls
Cinnamon rolls are a world-famous pastry made from a leavened yeast dough, filled with a sweet cinnamon-sugar butter, and typically finished with a rich cream cheese frosting.

Key Ingredients
Dough: Warm milk, active dry or instant yeast, sugar, melted butter, eggs, and all-purpose or bread flour.
Filling: Softened butter, brown sugar (for a deep caramel flavor), and plenty of ground cinnamon.
Frosting: Softened cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and a splash of milk.

Essential Equipment
To make professional-quality rolls, you will need:
- Stand Mixer: With a dough hook attachment (or a large bowl if kneading by hand).
- Rolling Pin: To roll the dough into a large, even rectangle.
- 9x13 inch Baking Pan: Glass or ceramic pans are excellent for keeping the edges soft.
- Unflavored Dental Floss: The secret "pro tip" to slicing the rolls cleanly without squashing the delicate layers of dough.

Simple Steps to Perfection
1. The Dough: Mix and knead the dough until smooth and elastic. Let it rise in a warm spot until doubled in size (usually 1.5 to 2 hours).
2. The Assembly: Roll the dough into a rectangle, spread it with softened butter, and sprinkle generously with the cinnamon-sugar mix.
3. The Roll: Roll it up tightly into a log. Use dental floss to "cross-cut" the log into 12 even rolls.
4. Second Rise: Place the rolls in a greased pan, cover, and let them rise again for about 30–45 minutes. This ensures they are light and fluffy.
5. Baking: Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 20–25 minutes until lightly golden brown.
6. The Finish: While the rolls are still warm, spread the cream cheese frosting over them so it melts slightly into the spirals.

New York Roll (The Suprême)
Making a New York Roll (also known as a Suprême) involves three main stages: creating the laminated pastry, baking them in circular molds to maintain their shape, and filling/decorating them.

1. Ingredients
Pastry: 250g flour, 120g cold water, 1 tsp instant yeast, 10g caster sugar, ½ tsp salt, and 180g cold unsalted butter (for laminating).
Filling: 180g pastry cream (vanilla or pistachio) or hazelnut spread.
Topping: 100g melted chocolate, chopped nuts (pistachios or hazelnuts), and simple syrup for glazing.

2. Instructions
Step 1: Prepare the Dough (Détrempe)
- Mix: Combine flour, sugar, salt, yeast, and water in a stand mixer. Knead for about 7 minutes until smooth.
- Rest: Wrap the dough and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

Step 2: Lamination (Creating Layers)
- Butter Block: Flatten your cold butter between parchment paper into a square.
- Lock-in: Roll the dough into a rectangle twice the size of the butter. Place the butter in the center and fold the dough over it.
- Turns: Roll the dough out and fold it into thirds (like a letter). Repeat this "turn" 2–3 times, chilling the dough for 30–45 minutes between each turn to keep the butter from melting.

Step 3: Shaping and Proofing
- Roll and Cut: Roll the final dough into a large rectangle (approx. 60x12 cm). Starting from the long edge, roll the dough tightly into a log.
- Molding: Cut the log into 3.5 cm thick discs. Place each disc into a greased 10 cm circular pastry ring on a baking tray.
- Proof: Let them rise in a warm place for about 1.5 to 2 hours until they nearly fill the rings.

Step 4: Baking
- Weight them down: Place a sheet of parchment paper and a second heavy baking tray on top of the rings. This prevents the rolls from rising vertically and forces them to keep their circular shape.
- Bake: Bake at 200°C (400°F) for 15–20 minutes, then remove the top tray and bake for another 10–15 minutes until golden brown.
- Glaze: Brush with simple syrup and return to the oven for 2 minutes for a caramelized finish.

Step 5: Filling and Finishing
- Fill: Once completely cool, use a knife or a Bismarck piping tip to poke two holes in the top or side. Inject pastry cream generously until the roll feels heavy.
- Decorate: Dip the top of the roll into melted chocolate or hazelnut spread. Sprinkle with crushed nuts or brittle before the chocolate sets.
