Classic American-Style Fluffy Pancakes
Here is a simple and delicious recipe for classic American-style fluffy pancakes.

Ingredients
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 3 ½ tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 Tbsp sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 ¼ cups milk
- 3 Tbsp unsalted butter, melted (plus extra for frying and serving)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract (optional)
- Optional toppings: maple syrup, fresh berries, sliced bananas, whipped cream

Instructions
Step 1: Combine the dry ingredients
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.

Step 2: Combine the wet ingredients
In a separate medium bowl, whisk the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract (if using) until smooth and well blended.

Step 3: Mix the batter
Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients. Stir gently with a spatula or whisk until just combined. It is okay if the batter is a little lumpy; do not overmix, as this can make the pancakes tough. Let the batter rest for 5 to 10 minutes while the pan heats up.

Step 4: Cook the pancakes
Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease the surface with a little butter or oil. Pour ¼ cup of batter onto the hot pan for each pancake. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set.

Step 5: Flip and serve
Flip the pancakes carefully with a thin spatula and cook for an additional 1 to 2 minutes, until golden brown on the other side. Repeat the process with the remaining batter. Serve the pancakes warm, stacked on a plate, with your favorite toppings.

Cinnamon Rolls
Cinnamon rolls are a world-famous pastry made from a leavened yeast dough, filled with a sweet cinnamon-sugar butter, and typically finished with a rich cream cheese frosting.

Key Ingredients
Dough: Warm milk, active dry or instant yeast, sugar, melted butter, eggs, and all-purpose or bread flour.
Filling: Softened butter, brown sugar (for a deep caramel flavor), and plenty of ground cinnamon.
Frosting: Softened cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and a splash of milk.

Essential Equipment
To make professional-quality rolls, you will need:
- Stand Mixer: With a dough hook attachment (or a large bowl if kneading by hand).
- Rolling Pin: To roll the dough into a large, even rectangle.
- 9x13 inch Baking Pan: Glass or ceramic pans are excellent for keeping the edges soft.
- Unflavored Dental Floss: The secret "pro tip" to slicing the rolls cleanly without squashing the delicate layers of dough.

Simple Steps to Perfection
1. The Dough: Mix and knead the dough until smooth and elastic. Let it rise in a warm spot until doubled in size (usually 1.5 to 2 hours).
2. The Assembly: Roll the dough into a rectangle, spread it with softened butter, and sprinkle generously with the cinnamon-sugar mix.
3. The Roll: Roll it up tightly into a log. Use dental floss to "cross-cut" the log into 12 even rolls.
4. Second Rise: Place the rolls in a greased pan, cover, and let them rise again for about 30–45 minutes. This ensures they are light and fluffy.
5. Baking: Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 20–25 minutes until lightly golden brown.
6. The Finish: While the rolls are still warm, spread the cream cheese frosting over them so it melts slightly into the spirals.

New York Roll (The Suprême)
Making a New York Roll (also known as a Suprême) involves three main stages: creating the laminated pastry, baking them in circular molds to maintain their shape, and filling/decorating them.

1. Ingredients
Pastry: 250g flour, 120g cold water, 1 tsp instant yeast, 10g caster sugar, ½ tsp salt, and 180g cold unsalted butter (for laminating).
Filling: 180g pastry cream (vanilla or pistachio) or hazelnut spread.
Topping: 100g melted chocolate, chopped nuts (pistachios or hazelnuts), and simple syrup for glazing.

2. Instructions
Step 1: Prepare the Dough (Détrempe)
- Mix: Combine flour, sugar, salt, yeast, and water in a stand mixer. Knead for about 7 minutes until smooth.
- Rest: Wrap the dough and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

Step 2: Lamination (Creating Layers)
- Butter Block: Flatten your cold butter between parchment paper into a square.
- Lock-in: Roll the dough into a rectangle twice the size of the butter. Place the butter in the center and fold the dough over it.
- Turns: Roll the dough out and fold it into thirds (like a letter). Repeat this "turn" 2–3 times, chilling the dough for 30–45 minutes between each turn to keep the butter from melting.

Step 3: Shaping and Proofing
- Roll and Cut: Roll the final dough into a large rectangle (approx. 60x12 cm). Starting from the long edge, roll the dough tightly into a log.
- Molding: Cut the log into 3.5 cm thick discs. Place each disc into a greased 10 cm circular pastry ring on a baking tray.
- Proof: Let them rise in a warm place for about 1.5 to 2 hours until they nearly fill the rings.

Step 4: Baking
- Weight them down: Place a sheet of parchment paper and a second heavy baking tray on top of the rings. This prevents the rolls from rising vertically and forces them to keep their circular shape.
- Bake: Bake at 200°C (400°F) for 15–20 minutes, then remove the top tray and bake for another 10–15 minutes until golden brown.
- Glaze: Brush with simple syrup and return to the oven for 2 minutes for a caramelized finish.

Step 5: Filling and Finishing
- Fill: Once completely cool, use a knife or a Bismarck piping tip to poke two holes in the top or side. Inject pastry cream generously until the roll feels heavy.
- Decorate: Dip the top of the roll into melted chocolate or hazelnut spread. Sprinkle with crushed nuts or brittle before the chocolate sets.

Ichigo Daifuku (Strawberry Mochi)
Ichigo Daifuku is a seasonal Japanese treat consisting of a fresh strawberry and sweet red bean paste (anko) wrapped in soft mochi. This 2026 recipe uses a microwave for a faster, easier process.

Ingredients
Strawberries: 6–8 small to medium, fresh and firm.
Filling: 120g–180g Anko (sweet red bean paste).
Mochi Dough:
- 100g Shiratamako or Mochiko (glutinous rice flour).
- 150ml Water.
- 2 tbsp Sugar (approx. 25g–30g).
Dusting: Potato starch or cornstarch (to prevent sticking).

Instructions
1. Prepare the Filling
- Prep Fruit: Wash, hull, and thoroughly dry the strawberries.
- Wrap in Anko: Divide the anko into 6–8 equal portions. Flatten each portion into a small disc and wrap it around a strawberry.
  Tip: You can cover the strawberry completely or leave the tip exposed for easier identification.
- Chill: Place the anko-covered strawberries in the refrigerator to firm up while you make the mochi.

2. Make the Mochi Dough
- Mix: In a microwave-safe glass bowl, whisk the rice flour, sugar, and water until smooth and lump-free.
- Microwave: Cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap. Microwave at 600W for 1.5 to 2 minutes.
- Stir: Remove and mix vigorously with a wet silicone spatula. The mixture will be lumpy and partly white.
- Final Cook: Microwave for another 1 minute. Stir again until the dough is smooth, sticky, and translucent (no longer opaque white).

3. Assembly
- Dust Surface: Generously coat a tray or work surface with starch.
- Divide: Scrape the hot mochi onto the starch and dust the top. Divide it into 6–8 equal pieces while still warm.
- Wrap: Flatten one piece of mochi into a 3-inch disc. Place an anko-covered strawberry in the center (tip down). Gently stretch the mochi over the base and pinch the edges to seal.
- Shape: Roll between your palms to smooth the shape, then place seam-side down.

Pro-Tips
Avoid the Fridge: Do not store the finished daifuku in the refrigerator; the cold makes mochi hard and rubbery. Store at room temperature in an airtight container and consume within 24–48 hours.
Clean Hands: Mochi is extremely sticky. Keep your hands and tools well-dusted with starch or slightly damp with water at all times.

Japanese Soufflé Cheesecake
This recipe is for the popular Japanese Soufflé Cheesecake, known for its jiggly, airy texture that melts in your mouth.

Ingredients
- Cream Cheese: 8 oz (225g), softened
- Eggs: 5 large (separated into yolks and whites)
- Unsalted Butter: 1/4 cup (60g)
- Whole Milk: 1/2 cup (120ml)
- Granulated Sugar: 1/2 cup (100g), divided
- Cake Flour: 1/2 cup (60g), sifted
- Cornstarch: 2 tablespoons
- Lemon Juice: 1 teaspoon (or 1/4 tsp cream of tartar)
- Vanilla Extract: 1 teaspoon

Instructions
1. Prep: Preheat your oven to 320°F (160°C). Line an 8-inch round cake pan with parchment paper on the bottom and sides.
2. Melt Base: In a saucepan over low heat, combine cream cheese, butter, and milk. Whisk until smooth, then remove from heat to cool slightly.
3. Yolk Mixture: Whisk egg yolks, vanilla, and 2 tablespoons of sugar into the cheese mixture. Sift in the cake flour and cornstarch, and fold gently until smooth.
4. Whip Meringue: In a separate clean bowl, beat egg whites with lemon juice (or cream of tartar) until foamy. Gradually add the remaining sugar and beat until soft peaks form (the tip should flop over when you lift the whisk).
5. Combine: Gently fold the egg whites into the yolk mixture in three parts using a spatula. Do not over-mix, or you will lose the air bubbles.
6. Water Bath: Pour the batter into the pan and tap it on the counter to release large air bubbles. Place the pan inside a larger roasting tray and fill the tray with 1 inch of hot water.
7. Bake: Bake at 320°F (160°C) for 20 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 285°F (140°C) and bake for another 40–50 minutes until golden on top.
8. Cool Slowly: Turn off the oven and leave the door slightly ajar for 15 minutes to let the cake cool slowly (this prevents it from collapsing).
9. Serve: Chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours before serving for the best flavor and texture.

Panna cotta is an elegant Italian dessert that is surprisingly easy to make with just a few main ingredients: cream, milk, sugar, gelatin, and vanilla. It is typically topped with a fruit coulis or fresh berries, as seen in the image. 
Ingredients (for 4-6 servings)
For the Panna Cotta: 
2 cups (475 ml) heavy cream
1 cup (240 ml) whole milk
½ cup (100g) granulated sugar
1 tbsp (about 2-3 sheets or 1 packet) unflavored gelatin
1 tbsp vanilla extract or 1 vanilla bean, split
For the Raspberry Coulis: 
2 cups (250g) fresh or frozen raspberries
¼ cup (50g) sugar (adjust to taste)
2 tsp lemon juice
Optional: Fresh mint leaves for garnish
Instructions
Step 1: Bloom the gelatin
In a small bowl or saucepan, combine the gelatin powder (or sheets) and a few tablespoons of cold water or milk, stirring until dissolved. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes to soften (hydrate/bloom). 
Step 2: Heat the cream mixture
In a medium saucepan, combine the heavy cream, milk, and sugar. If using a vanilla bean, scrape the seeds into the pan and add the pod. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until it is hot and steaming, but do not let it boil. The sugar should be completely dissolved. 
Step 3: Combine and chill
Remove the pan from the heat. Squeeze any excess water from the gelatin sheets, then whisk the bloomed gelatin into the warm cream mixture until it is completely dissolved. Pour the mixture into individual serving glasses or ramekins. Let them cool to room temperature, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4-6 hours, or overnight, until set. 
Step 4: Prepare the raspberry coulis
In a separate small saucepan, combine the raspberries, sugar, and lemon juice. Heat over medium heat, stirring and mashing the berries occasionally, until the mixture boils. Reduce the heat and simmer until it thickens slightly (about 5-10 minutes). 
Step 5: Finish and serve
Remove the coulis from the heat and allow it to cool completely. For a smoother sauce, you can strain it through a fine-mesh sieve to remove the seeds. Once the panna cottas are set, pour the raspberry sauce over the top of each serving and garnish with fresh mint leaves or extra raspberries.
