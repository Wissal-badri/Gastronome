Hargma (Kour3ine)
Hargma (also known as Kour3ine) is a slow-cooked Moroccan stew traditionally made with cow or lamb feet. It is famous for its rich, sticky texture caused by the high collagen content and its unique sweet-and-savory flavor profile.

Ingredients
Main: 2 large beef trotters (cleaned and cut into several pieces).
Legumes/Grains: 1 cup dried chickpeas (soaked overnight) and 1 cup wheat berries (optional, often tied in a cheesecloth bag).
Sweetness: ½ cup raisins.
Aromatics: 1 large onion (chopped), 4–6 garlic cloves (minced), and 3 tbsp olive oil.
Spices:
- 1 tsp turmeric and 1 tsp ground ginger.
- 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp ground cinnamon (or 2 sticks).
- 1 tsp cumin and a pinch of saffron threads.
- Salt and black pepper to taste.

Instructions
Prep the Meat: Thoroughly clean the trotters. It is helpful to blanch them in boiling water for 10 minutes, then drain and rinse again to ensure they are free of residue.
Sauté: In a large heavy-bottomed pot (or pressure cooker), heat the olive oil. Sauté the onions and garlic until softened.
Spice & Brown: Add the trotters to the pot along with all the spices. Stir well for 2 minutes to coat the meat and toast the spices until fragrant.
Initial Slow Cook: Add enough water to fully submerge the trotters (about 6–8 cups).
- Stovetop: Simmer covered on low for 3 hours.
- Pressure Cooker: Cook for 1.5 hours.
Add Chickpeas & Wheat: Add the soaked chickpeas and the wheat berries (if using). If the water level has dropped significantly, add enough to cover the ingredients again.
Final Simmer: Continue cooking until the chickpeas are tender and the meat is "fall-off-the-bone" soft.
- Stovetop: Another 1.5–2 hours.
- Pressure Cooker: 30–45 minutes.
The Sweet Finish: In the last 15–20 minutes of cooking, add the raisins. Continue simmering uncovered until the sauce has reduced to a thick, syrupy glaze.
Serve: Arrange the trotters on a large platter, surrounded by the chickpeas and raisins, and topped with the wheat berries. Serve hot with crusty Moroccan bread.

Traditional Tanjia Marrakchia
Traditional Tanjia Marrakchia is a meat-based confit known as "the bachelor's dish" because of its simple preparation: all ingredients are placed in a clay jar and slow-cooked until the meat falls off the bone.

Ingredients
Meat: 4 lbs (2 kg) of lamb or beef. Ideal cuts are gelatinous, such as shank (hock), neck, or tail.
Spices: 2 tsp ground cumin, 1 tsp saffron threads (crumbled), 1 tsp turmeric, and 1 tsp ginger.
Aromatics: 1 small head of garlic (approx. 8 cloves), unpeeled or lightly crushed.
Preserved Lemon: 1 whole preserved lemon, halved or quartered (remove seeds).
Fats: 1/4 cup olive oil and 1 tbsp smen (Moroccan fermented butter; sub with ghee or unsalted butter).
Liquid: 1/2 cup water.

Oven Instructions (Home Method)
1. Marinate: In a large bowl, rub the meat with the cumin, saffron, turmeric, ginger, and olive oil. Let it sit for at least 1 hour (ideally overnight).
2. Assemble: Place the meat in a deep, oven-proof dish (like a Dutch oven or heavy clay pot). Add the garlic cloves, preserved lemon, smen, and water.
3. Seal: Cover the top with parchment paper and then a layer of aluminum foil. Secure tightly to ensure no steam escapes.
4. Slow Cook: Place in a cold oven and set it to 275°F (140°C). Cook for 5 to 6 hours. The meat is done when it is incredibly tender and "melts" when touched.
5. Reduce (Optional): If there is too much liquid after cooking, simmer it uncovered on the stovetop for a few minutes until the sauce is thick and syrupy.

Serving
Serve the Tanjia hot in a large communal dish. It is traditionally eaten with khobz (Moroccan crusty bread) to mop up the rich, gelatinous sauce.

Authentic Bouillabaisse with Rouille and Croutons
Yields: 6 servings
Prep time: 30 minutes
Cook time: 1.5 - 2 hours

Ingredients
For the Broth
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 3 large onions, chopped
- 2 leeks (white part only), sliced
- 1 large fennel bulb, chopped (reserve fronds for garnish)
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 can (400g/14 oz) diced tomatoes
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 tsp saffron threads
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 tsp fennel seeds
- 1 strip of orange zest
- 1 cup dry white wine
- 4 cups fish stock (or 3 cups clam juice + 1 cup water)
- Salt and pepper to taste

For the Seafood
- 1 kg mixed firm fish (e.g., cod, monkfish, red snapper, sea bass), cut into large chunks
- 1 lb large shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 1 lb mussels, cleaned and de-bearded
- 1 lb clams, cleaned (optional)

For the Rouille (Garlic & Saffron Aioli) and Croutons
- 1/2 baguette, thinly sliced
- Olive oil for drizzling
- 2-3 slices white bread, crusts removed
- 1-2 cloves garlic, peeled
- 2 egg yolks
- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (or to taste)
- Pinch of saffron threads
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- Salt to taste

Instructions
Part 1: Prepare the Broth
1. Sauté Vegetables: In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat 1/2 cup olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions, leeks, and fennel. Sauté for about 10 minutes until softened but not browned.
2. Add Aromatics: Stir in the garlic, saffron, orange zest, bay leaves, thyme, and fennel seeds. Cook for another 2 minutes until fragrant.
3. Simmer Base: Pour in the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, white wine, and fish stock (or clam juice/water mixture). Bring to a simmer and cook uncovered for at least 30 minutes to allow flavors to infuse.
4. Blend & Strain: For an authentic smooth broth, remove the bay leaves, then blend the mixture using a hand blender until smooth. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean pot, pressing the solids to extract as much flavor as possible. Season with salt and pepper. Return the strained broth to a simmer.

Part 2: Prepare the Rouille & Croutons
1. Make Croutons: Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Place the baguette slices on a baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, and bake for 8-10 minutes until golden and crisp. For garlic croutons, rub a peeled garlic clove over the hot bread slices immediately after taking them out of the oven.
2. Make Rouille: In a food processor or with a mortar and pestle, combine the soaked white bread (squeeze out excess water), garlic cloves, egg yolks, cayenne pepper, and saffron. Blend into a paste. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil while blending until the sauce thickens into a mayonnaise-like consistency. Season with salt.

Part 3: Cook the Seafood and Serve
1. Poach Fish: Bring the strained broth back to a gentle simmer. Add the firmer fish chunks (like cod or monkfish) first. Cook for about 5 minutes.
2. Add Shellfish: Add the shrimp, mussels, and clams. Cover the pot and simmer for another 5–10 minutes, until the shrimp are pink and opaque and the mussel and clam shells have opened. Discard any mussels or clams that remain closed.
3. Serve: Ladle the hot bouillabaisse into bowls, ensuring a mix of fish and shellfish. Garnish with fresh parsley or the reserved fennel fronds. Serve immediately with the garlic croutons and a bowl of rouille on the side.

Lasagna alla Bolognese
Lasagna alla Bolognese is a multi-layered Italian classic composed of a slow-cooked meat ragù, creamy béchamel sauce, and delicate pasta sheets.

Ingredients
Ragù (Meat Sauce):
- 1 lb (500g) Ground beef (or beef/pork mix)
- 2 oz (50g) Pancetta, finely chopped
- 1 Carrot, 1 Celery stalk, 1 Onion (chopped)
- 1/2 cup Dry white or red wine
- 1 cup Whole milk (optional, for tenderness)
- 2-3 cups Tomato purée or crushed tomatoes

Béchamel (White Sauce):
- 4 tbsp Unsalted butter
- 4 tbsp All-purpose flour
- 3-4 cups Whole milk, warmed
- Pinch of Nutmeg, salt, and pepper

Pasta & Assembly:
- 1 box (approx. 12-15) Lasagna sheets
- 1-2 cups Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
- Butter for greasing

Preparation Steps
1. Prepare the Ragù
- Sauté: Cook pancetta in a heavy-based pot until fat renders. Add finely chopped carrot, celery, and onion (the soffritto); sauté until soft (about 5-10 minutes).
- Brown Meat: Add ground meat, breaking it up with a spoon, and cook until browned.
- Deglaze: Pour in the wine and let it evaporate almost completely.
- Simmer: Stir in tomato purée. Cover and simmer on low for at least 2–3 hours, adding broth or water if it gets too dry. Toward the end, stir in 1 cup of milk to reduce acidity.

2. Prepare the Béchamel
- Roux: Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook for 1-2 minutes without browning.
- Whisk: Gradually pour in warm milk while whisking constantly to prevent lumps.
- Thicken: Cook until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.

3. Assembly and Baking
- Bottom Layer: Spread a thin layer of ragù and béchamel at the bottom of a greased 9x13 inch baking dish.
- Layers: Place a layer of pasta sheets, followed by a layer of ragù, then béchamel, and a generous sprinkle of Parmigiano-Reggiano. Repeat for 5 to 7 layers.
- Top: Finish with a final layer of béchamel, a few dollops of ragù, and extra cheese.
- Bake: Pre-heat oven to 350°F (180°C). Bake for 30–40 minutes until golden and bubbling.
- Rest: Let the lasagna rest for 10–15 minutes before slicing to allow the layers to set.

Beef Shoyu Ramen
Yields: 4 servings | Prep time: 20 mins | Cook time: 1–3 hours (depending on beef cut)

Ingredients
The Beef & Broth:
- 1 lb Beef Brisket or Chuck (sliced thin)
- 8 cups Beef Stock (high quality, unsalted)
- 3 cloves Garlic, smashed
- 2-inch piece of Ginger, sliced
- 2 tbsp Vegetable Oil
The Seasoning (Alcohol-Free Tare):
- 1/3 cup Soy Sauce
- 1 tbsp Rice Vinegar (check that it is labeled "non-alcoholic")
- 1 tbsp Brown Sugar or Honey
- 1 tsp Sesame Oil
The Bowls:
- 4 portions Ramen Noodles (Wheat noodles)
- Garnish: Soft-boiled eggs, sliced green onions, nori sheets, and chili oil.

Instructions
1. Infuse the Broth: In a large pot, bring the beef stock, ginger, and garlic to a simmer. Cover and let it cook on low for at least 30 minutes to develop a deep, aromatic base.
2. Prepare the Seasoning Base: In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, rice vinegar, brown sugar, and sesame oil. This mixture replaces the traditional sweet rice wines with a balance of acidity and sweetness.
3. Sear the Beef:
- Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over high heat.
- Season the beef slices with salt and pepper.
- Sear the beef quickly (1–2 minutes per side) until browned and slightly crisp on the edges. Set aside.
4. Cook the Noodles: Boil a separate pot of water and cook the ramen noodles according to the package directions. Drain well.
5. Assembly:
- Place 2 tablespoons of the Seasoning Base into the bottom of each serving bowl.
- Ladle 2 cups of the hot, strained broth into each bowl and stir to combine with the base.
- Divide the noodles among the bowls.
- Top with the seared beef slices, half a soft-boiled egg, green onions, and a square of nori.

Tips for Success
- Richness: For a "creamy" beef broth without using dairy, you can whisk in a teaspoon of Tahini or peanut butter into the seasoning base.
- Authenticity: Use a Fine Mesh Strainer to remove the ginger and garlic pieces from your broth before serving for a clear, professional appearance.

The Classic American Smash Burger
Prep time	Cook time	Servings
15 mins	10 mins	4 Burgers
Ingredients
The Beef: 1.5 lbs (approx. 700g) of 80/20 ground chuck. Cold meat is essential for a good sear.
The Buns: 4 Brioche or potato buns, buttered and toasted.
The Cheese: 4–8 slices of American cheese (or mild Cheddar).
Toppings: Shredded iceberg lettuce, sliced tomatoes, red onion rings, and dill pickles.
Secret Sauce: Mix ½ cup mayonnaise, 2 tbsp ketchup, 1 tbsp yellow mustard, 1 tbsp sweet pickle relish, and a dash of onion powder. 
Instructions
Form Meat Balls: Gently divide the beef into 4 loose balls (about 170g each). Do not pack the meat tightly. Keep them refrigerated until the pan is hot.
Toast Buns: Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast them in a skillet over medium heat until golden brown.
The Smash: Heat a cast-iron skillet or griddle over high heat until it begins to smoke. Place a meat ball in the pan and immediately press it down hard with a flat, heavy metal spatula to create a thin, wide patty.
Season & Sear: Season the top with a generous pinch of salt and black pepper. Cook for about 2 minutes until a dark brown, crispy crust forms on the bottom.
Flip & Melt: Scrape the patty off the pan with a thin metal spatula to keep the crust intact and flip it. Immediately add the cheese. You can add a teaspoon of water and cover with a lid for 30 seconds to steam-melt the cheese.
Assemble: Spread a layer of sauce on the bottom bun. Stack your toppings (pickles, onions, lettuce, tomato) then the cheesy patty. Close with the top bun. 
2026 Burger Tips
The Blend: For a more gourmet flavor, ask your butcher to grind a 70/30 mix of chuck and brisket.
No Oil Needed: If your pan is hot enough and you use 80/20 beef, the fat from the meat will provide all the oil you need for searing.

To make authentic Southern fried chicken in 2026, focus on a buttermilk brine for moisture and a seasoned flour dredge for a crispy crust.
Ingredients
Chicken: 3 lbs of bone-in pieces (drumsticks, thighs, breasts).
Brine: 2 cups buttermilk, 1 tbsp hot sauce (optional), 1 tsp salt, and 1 tsp black pepper.
Dredge: 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 tbsp paprika, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder, and ½ tsp cayenne pepper.
Oil: Vegetable, peanut, or canola oil for frying. 
Instructions
Marinate: Place chicken in a bowl with the buttermilk mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight for the best results.
Coat: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour and spices. Remove chicken from the buttermilk, let excess drip off, and roll each piece in the flour mixture, pressing firmly to ensure it adheres.
Heat Oil: Fill a deep skillet or Dutch oven with about 2 inches of oil. Heat to 350°F (175°C).
Fry: Carefully add chicken in batches to avoid overcrowding. Fry for 12–15 minutes (turning halfway), until golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C).
Drain: Place cooked chicken on a wire rack or paper towels to remove excess oil. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving. 
Tips for 2026
Double Dredge: For extra crunch, dip the floured chicken back into the buttermilk and then into the flour again before frying.
Cornstarch: Replacing 1/2 cup of flour with cornstarch can result in a lighter, crispier texture.

Classic Homemade Macaroni and Cheese
This recipe serves 6–8 people and takes about 45–60 minutes to prepare. 
Ingredients
Pasta: 1 lb (approx. 500g) elbow macaroni.
Cheese: 4–5 cups freshly shredded cheese (sharp cheddar is classic; mixing with Gruyère or mozzarella adds depth).
Sauce Base (Roux): ¼ cup unsalted butter and ¼ cup all-purpose flour.
Liquid: 3–4 cups whole milk (warmed slightly to prevent lumps).
Seasonings: 1 tsp salt, ½ tsp black pepper, ¼ tsp paprika, and a "secret" pinch of nutmeg or dry mustard for depth.
Optional Topping: 1 cup panko breadcrumbs mixed with 2 tbsp melted butter. 
Step-by-Step Instructions
Boil the Pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the macaroni until al dente (usually 1–2 minutes less than the package instructions). Drain and set aside.
Make the Roux: In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1–2 minutes until bubbling and slightly golden to remove the raw flour taste.
Create the Béchamel: Slowly pour in the milk while whisking constantly to ensure no lumps form. Continue to cook and stir for 5–8 minutes until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.
Add Cheese & Seasonings: Remove the pan from the heat. Gradually stir in about 3/4 of your shredded cheese until completely melted and smooth. Stir in your salt, pepper, and optional seasonings.
Combine: Fold the cooked macaroni into the cheese sauce until every noodle is evenly coated. 
Finishing Options
Stovetop (Quick): Serve immediately while hot and gooey.
Baked (Classic): Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Transfer the mixture to a greased baking dish. Top with the remaining shredded cheese and the buttered breadcrumbs. Bake for 20–30 minutes until the top is golden and the edges are bubbling.

Ingredients
For the Meatloaf:
Beef: 1.5 to 2 lbs ground beef (80% or 85% lean is best for juiciness).
Binders: 3/4 cup breadcrumbs (Panko or Italian) and 2 large eggs.
Aromatics: 1 small onion (finely diced) and 2–3 cloves minced garlic.
Liquid/Moisture: 1/3 to 1/2 cup whole milk.
Seasoning: 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper, and 1 tsp Italian seasoning (or dried thyme).
Secret Tip (Optional): Add one small shredded apple (like Fuji) to the mix for extra moisture and flavor. 
For the Classic Glaze:
1/2 cup ketchup.
2 tbsp brown sugar.
1 tbsp mustard (yellow or Dijon).
1 tsp white or red wine vinegar. 
Instructions
Preheat & Prep: Heat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil or grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Sauté Aromatics: For better flavor, sauté the diced onions in a little butter or oil until translucent (about 5 minutes) before adding them to the meat.
Mix: In a large bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs, breadcrumbs, and seasonings first to create a paste (panade). Add the ground beef and onions. Mix with your hands until just combined—do not overmix, or the meatloaf will be tough.
Shape: Form the mixture into an 8x4-inch loaf on your baking sheet or press it gently into the loaf pan.
Bake: Bake uncovered for 40–45 minutes.
Glaze: Whisk the glaze ingredients together and spread evenly over the top of the meatloaf.
Finish: Return to the oven for another 15–20 minutes. The meatloaf is done when a meat thermometer reaches an internal temperature of 160°F (71°C).
Rest: Let the meatloaf rest for 10–15 minutes before slicing. This prevents the juices from running out and ensures a moist slice.

Sticky Asian-style BBQ Ribs are a flavorful dish that can be prepared in an oven or on a grill and are often served with an accompanying Asian slaw or noodle salad. 
Ingredients
For the Ribs: 
4 racks baby back ribs
1 litre carton pineapple juice
4 tbsp soy sauce
4 tbsp white miso paste
4 tbsp clear honey
For the Asian Slaw (Noodle or Cabbage): 
Rice noodles or shredded cabbage/mooli/carrots
Spring onions
Fresh herbs (coriander, mint)
2 tbsp sesame oil
4 tbsp rice vinegar
Seasoning to taste
Instructions
Step 1: Prepare and Cook the Ribs (Initial Braise)
Preheat your oven to 180°C (160°C fan/gas 4). Place the ribs, flesh-side down, in a large roasting tin. Pour over the pineapple juice, cover tightly with foil, and bake for 3 hours until tender. 
Step 2: Make the Glaze
After 3 hours, remove the ribs from the oven. Scoop 200ml of the cooking liquid into a small pan. Add the honey, soy sauce, and miso paste to the pan. Bring the mixture to a simmer and reduce until it forms a glossy, sticky glaze. 
Step 3: Finish and Glaze the Ribs
Turn the oven up to 200°C (180°C fan/gas 6), or prepare your BBQ for indirect cooking. Turn the ribs flesh-side up and baste them with half of the prepared glaze. Continue to cook for another 30-40 minutes (less time on a BBQ), basting with the remaining glaze every 10-15 minutes until they are sticky and shiny. 
Step 4: Prepare the Slaw
While the ribs are finishing, combine all of your chosen slaw/noodle salad ingredients (shredded vegetables, herbs, rice noodles) in a large bowl. Whisk the sesame oil and rice vinegar together with a splash of the rib glaze juices or additional soy/lime juice to make a dressing. Toss the salad ingredients with the dressing and season as needed.
