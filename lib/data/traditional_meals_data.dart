Authentic Bouillabaisse with Rouille and Croutons
Yields: 6 servings
Prep time: 30 minutes
Cook time: 1.5 - 2 hours

Ingredients
For the Broth
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 3 large onions, chopped
- 2 leeks (white part only), sliced
- 1 large fennel bulb, chopped (reserve fronds for garnish)
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 can (400g/14 oz) diced tomatoes
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 tsp saffron threads
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 tsp fennel seeds
- 1 strip of orange zest
- 1 cup dry white wine
- 4 cups fish stock (or 3 cups clam juice + 1 cup water)
- Salt and pepper to taste

For the Seafood
- 1 kg mixed firm fish (e.g., cod, monkfish, red snapper, sea bass), cut into large chunks
- 1 lb large shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 1 lb mussels, cleaned and de-bearded
- 1 lb clams, cleaned (optional)

For the Rouille (Garlic & Saffron Aioli) and Croutons
- 1/2 baguette, thinly sliced
- Olive oil for drizzling
- 2-3 slices white bread, crusts removed
- 1-2 cloves garlic, peeled
- 2 egg yolks
- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (or to taste)
- Pinch of saffron threads
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- Salt to taste

Instructions
Part 1: Prepare the Broth
1. Sauté Vegetables: In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat 1/2 cup olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions, leeks, and fennel. Sauté for about 10 minutes until softened but not browned.
2. Add Aromatics: Stir in the garlic, saffron, orange zest, bay leaves, thyme, and fennel seeds. Cook for another 2 minutes until fragrant.
3. Simmer Base: Pour in the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, white wine, and fish stock (or clam juice/water mixture). Bring to a simmer and cook uncovered for at least 30 minutes to allow flavors to infuse.
4. Blend & Strain: For an authentic smooth broth, remove the bay leaves, then blend the mixture using a hand blender until smooth. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean pot, pressing the solids to extract as much flavor as possible. Season with salt and pepper. Return the strained broth to a simmer.

Part 2: Prepare the Rouille & Croutons
1. Make Croutons: Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Place the baguette slices on a baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, and bake for 8-10 minutes until golden and crisp. For garlic croutons, rub a peeled garlic clove over the hot bread slices immediately after taking them out of the oven.
2. Make Rouille: In a food processor or with a mortar and pestle, combine the soaked white bread (squeeze out excess water), garlic cloves, egg yolks, cayenne pepper, and saffron. Blend into a paste. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil while blending until the sauce thickens into a mayonnaise-like consistency. Season with salt.

Part 3: Cook the Seafood and Serve
1. Poach Fish: Bring the strained broth back to a gentle simmer. Add the firmer fish chunks (like cod or monkfish) first. Cook for about 5 minutes.
2. Add Shellfish: Add the shrimp, mussels, and clams. Cover the pot and simmer for another 5–10 minutes, until the shrimp are pink and opaque and the mussel and clam shells have opened. Discard any mussels or clams that remain closed.
3. Serve: Ladle the hot bouillabaisse into bowls, ensuring a mix of fish and shellfish. Garnish with fresh parsley or the reserved fennel fronds. Serve immediately with the garlic croutons and a bowl of rouille on the side.
